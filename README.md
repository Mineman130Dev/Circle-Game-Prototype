# The Adventures of a Circle!

## A Minimalist Geometric Journey

The Adventures of a Circle! is an experimental game project that follows the journey of a simple geometric hero through an abstract world. After an initial development phase, this project is now available as an early alpha release for adventurous players to explore.

## Development Status

This project has been revived after a brief hiatus and is now entering a new, measured development phase. The current release (v0.1.0-alpha.0) represents the foundation upon which future updates will build.

## Try It Out!

This alpha release is available for early testing and feedback. While basic in its current form, it offers a glimpse into the concept and direction of the full experience we're working toward.

## Roadmap

Development will continue at a thoughtful pace, with quality prioritized over rapid releases. Updates will be released when meaningful progress has been made, rather than on a fixed schedule.

## Feedback Welcome

If you try the game, your impressions and suggestions are valuable! Feel free to submit issues or ideas that could help shape future development.
